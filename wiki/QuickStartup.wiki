     <div id="NextDataViewerContent" ></div>
}}}

Put following line in you GWT project's .gwt.xml file
{{{
<inherits name='com.next.viewer.NextDataViewer'/>
}}}

*Server Side setup*

3) Create a controller extending the class, com.next.viewer.server.DBServiceAbstract.

   Implement the abtract method 
   public Object getPersistanceManagerFactory().

If you follow the google's example to create the PersistanceManagerFactory for JDO object then implentaion of this class/function will be something like this
{{{
package com.mypackage.server;

Class MyControllerClass extends DBServiceAbstract{
	@Override
	public Object getPersistanceManagerFactory() {
		return PMF.get();
	}
}
}}}
4) Update your web.xml. Add the following code
{{{
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>DBServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>the class which you just created(com.mypackage.server.MyControllerClass)</servlet-class>
  </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>DBServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/<your application context>/dbviewer</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
}}}
